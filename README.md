Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant Express-Handlebars app that lets users:

- Input the names of burgers they'd like to eat. 
- View the burger selections on the left side of the page waiting to be devoured.
- Devour it! When the user clicks the "Devour it" button, the burger will move to the right side of the page. 

The users' activity is also stored into a database, whether devoured or not.
